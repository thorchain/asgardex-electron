/**
 * Midgard Public API
 * The Midgard Public API queries THORChain and any chains linked via the Bifr√∂st and prepares information about the network to be readily available for public users. The API parses transaction event data from THORChain and stores them in a time-series database to make time-dependent queries easy. Midgard does not hold critical information. To interact with BEPSwap and Asgardex, users should query THORChain directly.
