   * By switching the network, we have to re-direct to a top level route in following scenarios:
   * (1) Sub-routes of pools are redirected to the top-level route, since we don't have same pools on different networks
   * (2) Some (not all) sub-routes
   *
   * You might have following questions:
   *
   * (1) Why not handling this at service layer?
   * --------------------------------------------
   * We can't handle this at service layer, because it's recommended by React Router
   * to handle route states on view layer only. And `useNetwork` is used at view layer only.
   * Quote: "Our recommendation is not to keep your routes in your Redux store at all."
   * ^ @see https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/deep-redux-integration
   *
   * (2) Why don't we handle re-directing in views, where we defined our routes (such as `PoolsView` or `WalletView`)?
   * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Since we have to subscribe to `network$` to get changes by using `useSubscription` or something,
   * we get state of network after first rendering, but not before. With this, components are still trying to render data,
   * which might be deprecated based on network changes.
